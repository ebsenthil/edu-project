## Objective 
We are developing an AI-powered application designed to assist students in grades 9 through 12 within the U.S. education system, with a particular focus on California. The goal of the application is to guide students in planning their academic and career paths based on their individual profiles.

By analyzing a student's background—including their educational history, geographic location, academic performance, interests, hobbies, extracurricular involvement (such as leadership roles, clubs, and sports)—the AI system will provide personalized recommendations. These recommendations will include:

Suitable academic courses and subjects to pursue in high school

High schools or specialized programs in California that offer those courses

A clear roadmap of subjects and skills to develop in preparation for their desired college major or career path

Extracurricular activities and areas of expertise to focus on to strengthen their college applications

Step-by-step guidance to help them reach their long-term academic and career goals

Additionally, if the student enrolls in the platform, their progress will be continuously tracked. The system will provide feedback and adjustments as needed to help them stay on course and achieve their goals effectively.
